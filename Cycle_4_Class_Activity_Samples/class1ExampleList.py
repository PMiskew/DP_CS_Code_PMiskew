#Test Code findSumLSTA
#Sample lists for testing

#Test 1:
#No floats, No numeric values hiding as strings --> 7
lst1 = ["cat","dog",1,2,4,"2"]

#Test 2:
#Empty list --> 0
lst2 = []

#Test 3
#only strings --> 0
lst3 = ["cat","dog","fish"]

#Test 4
#only ints --> 55
lst4 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] 

#QUESTION: 	What test cases did I miss?
#QUESTION:  How does the putput change when one of the numbers is a decimal?  Try it on 
#			on one of the lst.
