Description: 

Write a method called findModSum2.  The method takes a list of integers and 
wo integer values.  The method returns the sum of all the elements that 
are between a (exclusive) and b (exclusive). 

Name: findModSum2
Parameters: int[] data, int a, int b
Returns: int

Preconditions: data is a list of integers a and b are both integers. 

findModSum2({2,3,10,9,14,25,3,100},5,25} â†’ 10 + 9 + 14 = 33
