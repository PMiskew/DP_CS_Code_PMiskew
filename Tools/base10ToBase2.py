Theory: To convert from Base 10 to any other base we 
divide by the new base (in this case 2) and use the remainder
and quotient to find the next step.  We stop when we reach 0

62 = 

62/2 = 31 R 0

31/2 = 15 R 1

15/2 = 7 R 1 

 7/2 = 3 R 1

 3/2 = 1 R 1 

 1/2 = 0 R 1

 DONE

 Read bottom up 

 62 = 111110

	Makes sesne since 62 is even and therefore the right
	most digit should be 0. 
 

45 = 101101

45/2 = 24 R 1

22/2 = 11 R 0

11/2 = 5  R 1

 5/2 = 2  R 1

 2/2 = 1  R 0

 1/2 = 0 R 1

 DONE

 Read bottom up - 45 = 101101
