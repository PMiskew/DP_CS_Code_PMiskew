#Div mod 10 algorithm
'''
Theory:

The mod operator (%) will give the remainder when division is performed
14 % 3 = 2

Why?  14/3 = 4R2, mod (%) simpley gives the remainder

Integer Division is what happens when two integers are divided. When
we integer divide we chop off decimal values. 

In python 3/4 = 0.75, however, in Java (and may other languages) 3/4 = 0. 

Why?  This is becasuse Java see 3 as and an integer and 4 as an integer
and assumes the result should be an integer so it integer divides.  Python
however tries to be helpful and thinks you want the decimals so leaves them

In Python // is integer divid
